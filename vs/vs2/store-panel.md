The Store Panel shows available expansion packs for VS. These expansions include additional patches, media and/or shaders.

Each item includes a short description, along with links to the preview videos and to purchase.

[We periodically update VS with new expansions designed by prolific media artists. Look forward to future packs!](https://www.imaginando.pt/products/vs-visual-synthesizer#section-expansions)
