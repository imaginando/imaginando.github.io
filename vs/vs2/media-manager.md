The Media Manager provides a general overview of the media assets (such as images and videos) used in your patch and lets you relocate missing media files.

The panel displays the **Media Name** and **Path** for each Layer. Any media that failed to load will appear in red. The **Relink Media** button can be used to reference a new folder containing the missing media. Please note that the file names must be the same for VS to successfully relink them.

If a media file was loaded from disk, you can **right click the file path** to open the context menu, and select **Show in Explorer** to open the folder containing the file. 

[When exporting custom banks or patches](patch-manager), you have the option to export assets as well. This will export the media files in a folder alongside the bank/patch file. Use the Media Manager to import the media when importing on another computer.
