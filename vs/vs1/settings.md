- **Profile** - Login to Imaginando account
- **MIDI** - configure MIDI input and output ports
- **Settings**
    - **Input audio device** - Select your desired input device to be used as an audio modulation source
    - **Output audio device** - Select your desired output device for playback of VSâ€™ demos
    - **Sample rate** - Select the sample rate to be used in VS audio engine
    - **Buffer size** - Select the buffer size to be used in VS audio engine
- **Render Output** - Enable NDI, Spout (Windows) or Syphon (Mac) video output
- **Frame rate** - The target refresh rate of VS render output (frames per second). Currently two options are available, 30 and 60 fps. For a smoother output try the 60 option
- **Output Resolution** - The resolution at which each layer is rendered. The lower the value, the smoother the visual output. For a more detailed visual output try a higher resolution
- **Render Quality** - choose between 'high performance' (more consistent framerate) or 'high resolution' (best quality)
- **Recording Quality** - the level of quality/detail of VS' video recordings. The higher the setting, the larger the file size
- **Voices** - the number of simultaneous polyphonic visual voices per layer. e.g. with 4 polyphonic voices, each layer can display 4 simultaneous instances of its material at once
- **Animated layer thumbnails** - choose whether layer thumbnails are animated or not

**Note: If the frames per second counter is below the target frame rate, it means that your GPU is not capable of delivering the frame rate you request. If that is the case, you should lower the quality setting until fps reaches your target frame rate.**
