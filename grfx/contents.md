# GRFX Help

Thank you for your interest in **GRFX - Granular Effects**.

GRFX is a granular audio effect plug-in for **deconstructing incoming audio into grains** with transposition, envelope shaping, rhythm generation and probabilistic capabilities. Its feature set lends itself to **experimentation** and shaping **simple sounds into textures, patterns and ambiances**.

The granulator engine is accompanied by **four LFO modulators** for additional expressiveness, as well as **two post-granulator Multi-effect slots** and **two Sends (Delay and Reverb)**, making GRFX an agile granular playground for serendipitous accidents and unexpected ideas.
