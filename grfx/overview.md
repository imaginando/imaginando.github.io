The GRFX interface is segregated into three horizontal regions. The **granulator engine** lies in the middle. Parameters regarding the **“macro” properties of the sound** - such as number of grains, buffer size and trigger frequency - are placed on the **left half**, while the **right contains parameters controlling the individual grains’ aspects**, such as their shape and size.

Dead centre of the granulator is the **Harmonic Triangle, an interactive pad for controlling the pitch shifting of the grains**. This element allows for creative tonal (and microtonal) effects, chord generation and shimmer effects. See [Harmonic Triangle](harmonic-triangle).

Under the granulator is the **Effect Rack**. The two leftmost effect slots are **Multi-effects**; each can be swapped for any effect from a list of **eight different effect engines**. To their right are the **sends: a Delay and a Reverb**. Unlike the Multi-effects, these are fixed and can work in series or parallel. The final slot is the **Mixer, with volume controls for the individual signal paths**, along with an **output volume** control and **Dry / Wet**. See [Effect Rack](effect-rack).

The top of the interface contains the **Modulator Rack**, displaying two of the **four available LFOs** at a time. These are used to modulate the plug-in’s various parameters and create autonomous movements and behaviors. See [Modulator Rack](modulator-rack).
