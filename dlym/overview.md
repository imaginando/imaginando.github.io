# DLYM Help - Overview

**DLYM** takes an input signal and allows the user to add a customised, simulated delay to the playback of the audio which results in phase irregularities, commonly referred to as chorus, flanger and phaser effects.

**DLYM** consists of a menu/status bar along the top, and controls to access the parameters below.

The left of the menu bar lists the name of the current preset/patch, and the right side contains the following icons and their respective operations:

- **DISK** - saves the current patch state \(by assigning a name\)

- **REVERT** - restores the currently loaded patch to its original saved state \(undo all changes\)

- **RANDOM** - assigns a random value to each parameter

- **UP** - selects the previous patch/preset from the list of patches

- **DOWN** - selects the next patch/preset from the list of patches
