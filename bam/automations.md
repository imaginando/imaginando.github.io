# AUTOMATIONS Panel

This panel provides clip-based step automation of the parameters of a
track’s Trigger, Engine, FX and Mixer devices. It also features the
timeline of the currently selected clip, which can be edited using the
same pencil types as the TIMELINE panel. Multiple parameters can be
automated, by adding them to the scrollable list on the left using the
LEARN button and moving the parameter you wish to add. Conversely you
can remove parameters from the list by selecting them and then clicking
the trash icon next to LEARN. Clicking a parameter from the list shows
its automations represented by a series of vertical bars, one for each
step of the clip. You can draw/erase automations manually by using the
automation tools, plus there are some preset ramp-shape shortcuts and
randomisation functions also present on the toolbar. For each parameter,
any step that is automated appears brighter in color, with non-automated
steps shaded darker. Using the erase tool resets a step’s automation and
thus returns it to the darker color.

You can access additional functions for some tools by using them with
the SHIFT button pressed which is on the bottom right corner of the app.

## Automation tool types

<br>

- **(a)** Write automation - write automation value bar on the corresponding step
- **(b)** Create probability range - with this tool you can create a range value of a parameter from which a value will be randomly chosen
- **(c)** Erase - delete the step automation

SHIFT functions:
- Add a parameter to clip automations when pressing it
- Shift between Pencil and Eraser on the automation Tool type
- Selection of Loop zone when it is active

## How to automate a parameter

There is more than one way to automate a parameter in BAM. Any time a
parameter is automated it is always added to the Automation page list.
When a parameter is added to the automation page list its value is
always associated with the current clip. These are the ways in which you
can automate parameters in BAM:

- Automate a parameter through adding the parameter to the Automations page and writing the desired values on each step.
- Change the value of a parameter in a single step by pressing and holding the Step on the Automations page or the Timeline page and manipulating the parameter. (iOS only)
- Manipulate a parameter directly while the record button is active
- Holding the Shift key and manipulating a parameter will change the value of that parameter for the whole clip.

Whenever a parameter is either automated or modulated you can confirm
its activity by a small dot moving around the parameter knob showing the
automated or modulated new value.

If a parameter control is manipulated directly while it is being
automated, this will bypass its automation and the icon near the Record
button (re-enable automation) will light red showing that automations
have been bypassed. By pressing this icon BAM will return automations to
normal.
