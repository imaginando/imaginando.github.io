# Sample Manager and Factory Soundbank

The Sample Manager allows browsing and preview audio files and presets, 
as well as recording from a designated audio input source. It can be 
accessed by pressing the right corner icon in the Top Bar.

<br>

The bottom of the window features a preview player enabling auditioning of
samples. When active, the headphone icon enables auto-play of samples
and engine presets when pressing them. Long pressing a sample/preset name in 
the Browser or Pool will make a **Hot Swap**. This temporarily replaces the 
sound in the currently selected track for previewing. This is useful 
for previewing sounds in the context of the current project.

The play button plays the currently selected sample, and the volume of
the preview audio can be controlled with the volume knob on the right.

The panel is split into three tabs: **Sample Pool**, **File Browser**
and **Recorder**.

### Pool

<br>

Each BAM project has its own sample pool to store up to 128 imported
samples. Samples can be added to the pool from the file browser by
selecting the **add to pool** <img src="/bam/images/sample-manager-soundbank/bam-beat-maker-sample-manager-add-to-pool.png" width="20" alt="sample-manager-pool.png" /> 
button to the right of the file name. Dragging and dropping a sample 
from the Browser on the Engine Device, Timeline Track Name or the Track 
Pad will add the sample to the pool if not present. Samples are imported 
into the first available empty slot in the pool and automatically 
assigned an index number, which is used by the **Sample** parameter 
in the Sampler engine. The pool content is saved with the project. 

### Browser

<br>

The file browser provides access to all of the Factory sound bank
samples and engine presets, user created presets and recordings. In 
desktop, you can also access the file system to browse local storage.

<br>

You can add shortcuts for specific folder locations using the **Add folder bookmark** button.

### Recorder

<br>

Here you can record samples from BAM’s master channel output or from any
of your device’s available audio inputs. You can also crop the recorded
sample by adjusting the start and end knobs **(A)** or interacting with the
waveform area **(C)** and selecting the crop button **(B)**. When recording 
from the Master Output, silence will be automatically trimmed from the 
beginning of the file. You can use the recorded sample by dragging and 
dropping it. You may also use the top right icons to add the selected 
file to the pool **(D)** and, on iOS, export the file **(E)**.
