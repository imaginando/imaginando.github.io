# The BAM workflow
BAM is a groovebox style application ready for full autonomous music production. It comes with sound engines, effects units, a mixer, various panels for MIDI clips and automation editing as well as a factory soundbank.

The starting point for music creation in BAM will probably be one of these two options: load a sample or open an Engine device on a track. These will be your primary sound sources for composition which you can then edit or process further through FX devices. You will be stacking these up to 16 tracks and mixing them down on a mixer with routing for two FX sends and a master track for more FX processing.

On the panels is where most of the work on BAM will be done and where you can access most of its functionalities. Here you can add or remove sound sources and effects units; add, edit and delete notes; create automations and complex sequences of music events; fine tune your individual tracks and mix all audio.

From there you can start creating your MIDI clips through either the TIMELINE or the COMPOSER by creating and editing notes which can then be sequenced in clips through the MATRIX panel. Finally you add and create movement to your compositions and give them some sparkle by generating modulations through the MODULATORS panel or through the AUTOMATIONS panel.
