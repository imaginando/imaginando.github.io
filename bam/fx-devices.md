# FX Devices

## AUDIO UNIT 

BAM allows loading external Audio Unit v3 plugin effects. For information on 
exposing AUv3 plugin parameters for mapping, automation and modulation see 
the [Device Rack](device-rack#modulating-parameters-from-auv3-plugins) section.

AUv3 presets are browsable in a drop-down menu in the rack panel.

## BIT REDUCTION

<br>

Degrade the audio bit depth, introducing audible quantization error artifacts.

- **DEPTH** - Audio bit depth
- **DRY/WET** - Mix between the unprocessed and processed signals

## CHORUS

<img src="/bam/images/fx-devices/bam-beat-maker-fx-chorus.png" width="" alt="BAM Chorus FX device" />

<br>

Stereo chorus effect (it converts mono signals to stereo) with two different 
algorithms. The CHORUS simulates the subtle pitch and timing differences 
that occur when multiple musicians or vocalists play the same note, but 
vary slightly in pitch and timing.

- **RATE** - Frequency of the modulations
- **TIME** - Delay of the modulated signal
- **DEPTH** - Modulation amount
- **SPREAD** - Stereo image widening effect
- **FEEDBACK** - Amount of signal to be fed back into the circuit
- **MODE** - Switch between two different CHORUS algorithms
    - **ANA** - Analog
    - **DIM** - Dimension
- **DRY/WET** - Mix between the unprocessed and processed signals

## COMPRESSOR

<img src="/bam/images/fx-devices/bam-beat-maker-fx-compressor.png" width="" alt="BAM Compressor FX Device" />

<br>

A flexible and versatile compressor with side-chain capabilities, suitable 
for controlling audio transients and managing perceived loudness.

- **THRESHOLD** - Level at which the compressor starts acting
- **RATIO** - Gain reduction ratio applied to the input signal above the 
    threshold
- **ATTACK** - Time it takes for the gain reduction to be fully applied 
    after the signal surpasses the threshold
- **RELEASE** - Time it takes for the gain reduction to fully dissipate 
    after the signal goes below the threshold
- **MODE** - Select between feedforward and feedback compression algorithms
    - **FF** - The gain reduction is based on the clean input signal.
    - **FB** - The compressed output is fed back into the sidechain, 
        meaning the compressor reacts to the signal after it has already 
        been compressed. This makes the gain reduction soften over time.
- **STYLE** - Control the character of the gain reduction envelopes
    - A lower value results in very fast envelopes and can result in 
        ripples and distortion similar to a FET compressor. A higher value 
        behaves like a cleaner VCA compressor.

### Side Chain

- **SC SOURCE** - Source for the compressor's analysis signal
- **SC GAIN** - Input volume of the compressor's analysis signal

    the perceived loudness after the compression

controls, a custom filter and stereo parameters.

- **FEEDBACK** - Amount of the output signal fed back into the 
    circuit

    the signal

    the flutter of a tape machine
- **WOW** - Amount of slow frequency modulation generated by the 
    playback speed variations of a tap machine

## FILTER

<img src="/bam/images/fx-devices/bam-beat-maker-fx-filter.png" width="" alt="BAM Filter FX Device" />

<br>

A multi-mode filter with 6 different modes.

- **CUTOFF** - Filter cutoff frequency
- **RESONANCE** - Resonance or Q factor of the filter; creates a resonant 
    peak at the cutoff frequency
- **MODE** - Filter mode
    - **L4P** - 4 pole Low-pass Filter (24dB/oct attenuation) - A low-pass 
        filter allows low frequency content to pass through, cutting high 
        frequency content at a rate defined by the number of poles. This 
        filter is a digital implementation of the Moog Transistor Ladder 
        Filter.
    - **L2P** - 2 pole Low-pass Filter (12dB/oct - thus less frequency
        cutting effect than the L4P) - This filter is a digital
        implementation of an analog multi-mode filter topology in the
        low-pass mode. 
    - **B2P** - 2 pole Band-pass Filter (12dB/oct) - A
        band-pass filter allows only a restricted frequency band to pass
        through, attenuating frequencies above and below. In this filter 
        the Q factor has a particular importance as it somewhat defines 
        the bandwidth that can pass through the filter. This filter represents 
        the band-pass output of the analog multi-mode filter implementation.
    - **H2P** - 2 pole High-pass Filter (12dB/oct) - A high
        -pass filter allows high frequency content to pass through,
        attenuating low frequency content. This filter represents the 
        high-pass output of the analog multi-mode filter implementation.
    - **NOTCH** - Notch Filter - A notch filter is a filter that cuts a very
        restricted band of frequencies. The Q factor designates how narrow the
        band is. Can be used to achieve a phaser-like effect, especially  
        when modulating the cutoff. This filter is also a product of the
        multi-mode filter topology used in the other filters (except L4P).
    - **PEAK** - Peak Filter - A peak filter amplifies a frequency band with the 
        resonance determining the amplification amount and 
        creating a resonant peak at high values.

This center frequency is modulated by controllable LFOs.
