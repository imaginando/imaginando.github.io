**TV3** is a plug-in synthesizer inspired by the TB-303, a machine
that has become ubiquitous in the realms of electronic music. Its
unmistakable, corrosive sound is closely associated with "acid" genres,
among them acid house and acid techno.

This plug-in is designed for a streamlined workflow, making it
exceptionally easy to create synth lines. Exporting the generated MIDI
to your DAW for further editing is as simple as dragging and dropping.

The **TV3** interface is optimized for quick access to key parameters.
On the left, you'll find the sequence generation panel and export area,
while the right side has the basic synthesis engine controls. At the
centre sits the **TV** itself. When **Advanced** options are enabled,
it reveals the complete set of synthesis parameters; otherwise, a
suspicious little character will keep you company. Clicking him
randomizes the parameters.

At the top of the interface, you'll find the patch manager with
**navigation arrows for browsing patches**, along with icons for the
**undo**, **redo**, **save** and **revert** functions.

In terms of synthesis, the **TV3** offers a **main oscillator**, a
**sub oscillator**, a **lowpass filter** and a multimode **distortion
stage**. With the controls restricted to their most useful ranges, the
instant randomize feature allows for quick exploration.

The **sequence generation** features twenty one different scales per key
to choose from, with tweakable length and complexity. Generated sequences
will play alongside your DAW's transport.
**MIDI export** is drag-and-drop, letting you take MIDI clips into your
DAW and work from there.

The signature **Accent** effect from the original machine is applied to
notes with velocity values above 100, while overlapping notes will
**slide**.
