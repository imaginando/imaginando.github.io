# Patch Manager

The **patch manager** is centrally located at the top of the interface.

## **BROWSING**

Use the **left and right arrows** to quickly navigate through saved patches. The current patch name is displayed in the text field. If you've made changes to the patch, an asterisk will appear in front of its name, indicating it's been modified.

## **SAVING**

Press the **save** icon to store your current patch in the patch bank. Any generated internal patterns will be saved along with the patch.

## **UNDO / REDO**

The **undo** and **redo** icons are positioned to the right of the **save** icon. Use them to reverse or reapply parameter changes, pattern generation, or parameter randomization commands.
