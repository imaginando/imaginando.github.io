## **BROWSING**

Use the **left and right arrows** to quickly navigate through saved
patches. The current patch name is displayed in the **text field**.
If you've made changes to the patch, an asterisk will appear in front
of its name, indicating it's been modified.

Clicking the **patch name** will display the **Factory** and **Local**
banks in the **TV**. The **Factory** bank comes with several patches,
while the **Default** bank will show the patches you've saved.

## **SAVING**

Press the **save** icon to store your current patch in the **Local**
bank. Any generated internal patterns will be saved along with the
patch.

## **UNDO / REDO**

The **undo** and **redo** icons are positioned to the right of the
**save** icon. Use them to reverse or reapply parameter changes, pattern
generation, or parameter randomization commands.

The **revert** button recovers the saved state of the currently selected
patch, discarding your changes.
