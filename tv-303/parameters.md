# Parameters

The rightmost side of the interface shows the basic controls laid out vertically. The remainder of the parameters can be accessed through the **Advanced** button on the **TV**.

## **BASIC VIEW**

- **Cutoff** - The cutoff frequency for the main filter. As in the original machine, this parameter reaches up to 1200Hz. However, the cutoff point can be pushed further when affected by an **accent** or modulated by the envelope (see **Env. Mod**).

- **Resonance** - The amount of filter resonance. Forms a resonant peak on top of the cutoff frequency.

- **Accent** - Amount of volume boost and added frequency modulation for notes with accent. Accent is applied to all notes with a velocity value above 100.

- **Env. Mod** - Amount of envelope modulation applied to the filter cutoff. 

- **Decay** - Decay time of the primary envelope. This envelope is fully responsible for the filter modulation, but factors only lightly into the amplitude envelope.

- **Drive** - Pre-distortion signal gain. Adjust for harsher or lighter distortion.

- **Dry/Wet** - The dry/wet balance between the original and the distorted signal.

## **ADVANCED**

If the **Advanced** option is toggled, additional controls become available within the **TV**.

### **Osc**

- **Waveform** - Select between a square or sawtooth waveform for the main oscillator.

- **Tuning** - Fine-tune both the main and sub oscillators within a range of -1200 and +1200 cents.

### **Sub**

The sub oscillator plays on octave below the main oscillator.

- **Waveform** - Select between a square or sawtooth waveform for the sub oscillator.

- **Volume** - Volume of the sub oscillator.

### **Distortion**

The distortion stage is applied after the main filter.

- **Type** - Choose from four different distortion types:
    - **SAT** - Classic saturation waveshaping
    - **CLIP** - Hard clipping
    - **NOCK** - Asymmetrical waveshaping that introduces small discontinuities in the crest for a noisy sound
    - **FOLD** - Sinusoidal wavefolding

- **Highpass** - Pre-distortion highpass filter. Gradually attenuates the fundamental and reaches up to the first harmonic of the oscillator output.
